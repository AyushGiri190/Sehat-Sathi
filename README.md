This project tackles disease identification through a user-friendly web platform.  Imagine experiencing concerning symptoms and wanting to explore potential causes. This tool allows you to browse a categorized library of X-ray images showcasing various diseases. Feeling feverish and coughing? Input your symptoms and the system analyzes them, suggesting relevant illnesses. You can then delve deeper by comparing these suggestions with actual X-ray images from the database. If you have your own X-ray results, you can even visually compare them. While this offers a starting point for understanding, a key disclaimer is emphasized: this is for informational purposes only. A proper diagnosis should always come from a licensed medical professional.  This project empowers individuals with a preliminary exploration of their health concerns, but it should never replace consulting a doctor.
